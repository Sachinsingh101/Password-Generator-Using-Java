# Password Generator
This is simple password Generator using java

I decided to build this project during the Winter Break of my third year after Learning the basics of Java . I wanted to build something interesting with Java to practice and see what I could do on my own. However, I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Then one night, while explaining to my father the importance of having a strong password for his social media accounts, I got the idea of creating a random password generator. A week later, it was done.
I have also implement GUI so everyone can  use it.

However this project is a basic level and cannot treated to be use in distributed environment.






## Functionalities

- First the user is prompted with a simple ui that saves users actions
- There a four options user can play with
- When click on Generat Button a random password will generated based on user's selections.
- That all for now.
